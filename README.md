# Minecraft-CreateAddons
Some adjustments of a Minecraft NeoForge mod "Create" that I believe are more realistic

Adjustments as follow:

1 : versions\Create-Delight-Remake\kubejs\data\createdieselgenerators\createdieselgenerators\fuel_type\ethanol.json
  i) Adjusted 3 engines output strength when ethanol is used as fuel : 9216 --> 8192
2 : versions\Create-Delight-Remake\kubejs\server_scripts\extensions.js
  i) Add "ethylene_fluid" As a kind of fuel
  ii) Add Indirect Hydration Process for Ethanol production
3 : I tried to add ethene_fluid as a kind of fuel available for the engine.But I failed.But only at most now.:(
